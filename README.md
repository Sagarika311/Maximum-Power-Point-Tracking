# Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
The aim is to predict the optimal duty cycle for a solar panel system using an Artificial Neural Network, based on irradiance, temperature, and previous power output.

# Step 1: Importing the required modules
Import the following modules:

numpy: For numerical operations on arrays.
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
sklearn.model_selection: For splitting data into training and testing sets.
tensorflow.keras: For building and training the neural network.

# Step 2: Loading and Preprocessing Data
Prepare the dataset for training and testing:

Load data from a CSV file using pandas.
Select features (irradiance, temperature, previous_power) and target (optimal_duty_cycle).
Split the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split.

# Step 3: Defining the ANN Model
Build the Artificial Neural Network model:

Use Sequential model from Keras.
Add three Dense layers:

Input layer with 16 neurons and ReLU activation.
Hidden layer with 32 neurons and ReLU activation.
Output layer with 1 neuron and linear activation.

# Step 4: Compiling the Model
Set up the model for training:

Use Adam optimizer.
Use Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function.
Track Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as an additional metric.

# Step 5: Training the Model
Train the ANN on the prepared data:

Use the fit() method of the model.
Train for 100 epochs with a batch size of 10.
Use 20% of the training data for validation.

# Step 6: Evaluating the Model
Test the performance of the trained model:

Use the evaluate() method on the test data.
Print the Mean Absolute Error.

# Step 7: Implementing MPPT Function
Create a function to predict optimal duty cycle:

Define mppt_using_ann function that takes irradiance, temperature, and previous power as inputs.
Use the trained model to predict the optimal duty cycle.

# Step 8: Example Prediction
Demonstrate the use of the MPPT function:

Set example values for current irradiance, temperature, and previous power.
Call the mppt_using_ann function with these values.
Print the predicted optimal duty cycle.

This code demonstrates the process of creating an Artificial Neural Network to predict the optimal duty cycle for Maximum Power Point Tracking in solar panel systems. The ANN is trained on historical data and can then be used to make real-time predictions based on current conditions. This approach can potentially improve the efficiency of solar energy systems by continuously adjusting the duty cycle to maximize power output under varying environmental conditions.
